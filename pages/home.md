background_title: "Brief History"
background_desc: "Our network has for a decade united researchers, clinicians, and industry partners in the pursuit of advancing women’s health within the field of neuroimmunology. This has produced impactful publications, driven new insights into disease mechanisms, and fostered a supportive, dynamic research community. <br /><br />
With these advances come a formalization of that collective work, aiming to streamline efforts and reduce administrative burdens to individual investigators, and provide a flexible framework for expanding our network. By organizing and consolidating resources and expertise, we aspire to enhance the quality and reach of our research in neuroimmunological diseases.<br /><br />
We welcome new researchers to the field and foster the inclusion of diverse perspectives. We therefore provide mentorship and collaboration opportunities to cultivate the next generation of leaders in neuroimmunology and women’s health research."
